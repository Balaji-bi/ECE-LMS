**Simple Terms:** Imagine you're on a merry-go-round. Your position keeps changing as it spins, but your distance from the center (amplitude) and how fast it spins (frequency) stay constant. A phasor represents this spinning motion. Instead of watching you go round and round, we can use an arrow (the phasor) whose length is your distance from the center and whose angle shows your current position. This simplifies analyzing sinusoidal signals in circuits.

**Technical Depth:** A phasor is a complex number representing a sinusoidal function whose amplitude (A), angular frequency (œâ), and initial phase (Œ∏) are time-invariant. It transforms a sinusoidal time-domain function into a complex number in the frequency domain, simplifying steady-state AC circuit analysis by replacing differentiation and integration with algebraic operations. The phasor has a magnitude corresponding to the amplitude of the sinusoid and an angle corresponding to its phase shift.

**Methodology & Working Principles:** Phasors are applied in steady-state AC circuit analysis. We represent voltages and currents as phasors, then use complex number arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to analyze circuit behavior. The fundamental principle is Euler's formula, which connects complex exponentials to trigonometric functions, allowing us to represent sinusoids as complex numbers.

**Concise Summary:** Phasors simplify AC circuit analysis by representing sinusoidal signals as complex numbers, enabling the use of algebraic operations instead of calculus.
