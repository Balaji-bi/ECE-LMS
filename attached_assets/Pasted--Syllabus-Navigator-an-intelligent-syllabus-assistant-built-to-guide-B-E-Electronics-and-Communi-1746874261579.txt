syllabus:
if I click semester 1: it shows the subject list
subject list:PH3151 ENGINEERING PHYSICS, GE3151 PROBLEM SOLVING AND PYTHON PROGRAMMING 
if  i click PH3151 ENGINEERING PHYSICS from the suject list 
it list out the units of the PH3151 ENGINEERING PHYSICS like 
UNIT 1 -  MECHANICS , UNIT 2 -  ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES, UNIT 3 -  OSCILLATIONS, OPTICS AND LASERS, UNIT 4 -  BASIC QUANTUM MECHANICS, UNIT 5 -  APPLIED QUANTUM MECHANICS 
if I click unit 1 - MECHANICS it list out the topics in that unit like 
Multi-particle dynamics: Center of mass (CM) ‚Äì CM of continuous bodies ‚Äì motion of the CM ‚Äì kinetic energy of the system of particles. Rotation of rigid bodies: Rotational kinematics ‚Äì rotational kinetic energy and moment of inertia - theorems of M .I ‚Äìmoment of inertia of continuous bodies ‚Äì M.I of a diatomic molecule - torque ‚Äì rotational dynamics of rigid bodies ‚Äì conservation of angular momentum ‚Äì rotational energy state of a rigid diatomic molecule - gyroscope - torsional pendulum ‚Äì double pendulum ‚ÄìIntroduction to nonlinear oscillations. 
if I click any topic from the list out topics like i click center of mass(CM) means AI model will generate content about center of mass (CM)

if i click unit 2 - ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES from the unit list. it list the second unit topic like
The Maxwell‚Äôs equations - wave equation; Plane electromagnetic waves in vacuum, Conditions on the wave field - properties of electromagnetic waves: speed, amplitude, phase, orientation and waves in matter - polarization - Producing electromagnetic waves - Energy and momentum in EM waves: Intensity, waves from localized sources, momentum and radiation pressure - Cell-phone reception. Reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves from a non-conducting medium-vacuum interface for normal incidence. 

if I click any topic from the list out topic like i click the maxwell's equation means AI model will generate content about the maxwell's equation.


if i click GE3151 PROBLEM SOLVING AND PYTHON PROGRAMMING  from the subject list
it list out the units for GE3151 PROBLEM SOLVING AND PYTHON PROGRAMMING  like
UNIT 1 - COMPUTATIONAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING, UNIT 2 - DATA TYPES, EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS, UNIT 3 - CONTROL FLOW, FUNCTIONS, STRINGS, UNIT 4 - LISTS, TUPLES, DICTIONARIES, UNIT 5 - FILES, MODULES, PACKAGES
If I click unit 1 -  COMPUTATIONAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING, it list out the topic from that unit like
Fundamentals of Computing ‚Äì Identification of Computational Problems -Algorithms, building blocks of algorithms (statements, state, control flow, functions), notation (pseudo code, flow chart, programming language), algorithmic problem solving, simple strategies for developing algorithms (iteration, recursion). Illustrative problems: find minimum in a list, insert a card in a list of sorted cards, guess an integer number in a range, Towers of Hanoi. 

if i click any topic from the topic list, like if i click building blocks of algorithms (statements, state, control flow, functions) means AI model will generate content about like building blocks of algorithms (statements, state, control flow, functions) like wise all units

if i click semester 2, it list out the subject in semester 2
